## The project is deployed to Heroku. @ https://eryn-monestero-portfolio.herokuapp.com/
### Tools used:
* JavaScript
* Node
* HTML5
* CSS3
* Sendgrid
## A little about the project.
### It was designed with a responsive SPA in mind. I wanted something that had a clean look and wasn't distracting to the user. Sendgrid is used for the messaging service that sends a customized email template to me.

## The portfolio is optimized for search engines, load times, and designing for screen reader compatibility.

### Tested with Lighthouse
